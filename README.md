YOLOv3 is a SOTA (state-of-the-art) real-time Object Detection model. It was published in April 2020 by Alexey Bochkovsky; it is the 4th installment to YOLO. It achieved SOTA performance on the COCO dataset which consists of 80 different object classes. YOLO is a one-stage detector. The One- stage method is one of the two main state-of-the-art methods used for the task of Object Detection, which prioritizes on the inference speeds. In one-stage detector models ROI (Region of Interest) is not selected, the classes and the bounding boxes for the complete image is predicted. Thus, this makes them faster than two-stage detectors. Other examples are FCOS, RetinaNet, SSD. It divides the object-detection task into regression task followed by a classification task. Regression predicts classes and bounding boxes for the whole image in single run and helps to identify the object position. Classification determines the objectâ€™s class. The following set of images shows in details the model created based on YOLOv3 algorithm output.
